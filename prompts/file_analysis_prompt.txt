Message 2 content: We need to verify the contents of several files in order to determine if they contain PII or sensitive information.
Given the list of files, please generate code which opens the file, and prints the contents of the file in plain text. This should be done for each file.

- If the file is a type of text document, simply open and print the contents.
- If the file is a PDF, try to open and print the contents, ensuring no external libraries are used.
- If the file is an image, try to determine what the contents could be based on the file name.
- For each file, generate a fall back which simply describes the file contents based on the filename, in case opening and reading the file fails.
- Print a maximum of the first 50 lines from each file.

Here is the list of files:
